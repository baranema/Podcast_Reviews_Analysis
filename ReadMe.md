# Podcast Reviews dataset analysis

Project by Emilija B. originally created in **October 2022**. The project was uploaded later because it was previously stored in a different repository.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file 225.ipynb that demonstrates natural language processing techniques for analyzing podcast reviews. The notebook was created as a project for a data science course and uses a dataset of podcast reviews obtained from Kaggle.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need to have Python 3 and the following Python packages installed:

* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* nltk

## Usage

* Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
* Navigate to the directory containing the notebook file (225.ipynb).
* Start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:

```
jupyter notebook
```

* In Jupyter Notebook, open the 225.ipynb file.
* Run each cell in the notebook in order.

Note: Before running the notebook, make sure to download the dataset from Kaggle and place the movie_reviews folder in the same directory as the notebook file.
